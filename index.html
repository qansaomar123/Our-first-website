      At a very basic level, physical activity means any movement of your body that uses your muscles and expends energy.
      One of the great things about physical activity is that there are endless possibilities and there will be an activity to suit almost everyone!
      For adults, physical activity can include recreational or leisure-time physical activity, transportation (e.g. walking or cycling), occupational
       activity (i.e. work), household chores, play, games, sports, or planned exercise in the context of daily, family, and community activities.
    </p>

      Everyday things such as walking to the bus stop, carrying bags or climbing stairs all count, and can add up to the 150 minutes of exercise a week
      recommended for the average adult. Physical activity has been shown to have a positive impact on our mood.There are many studies looking at physical
      activity at different levels of intensity and its impact on people’s mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, research has found that low-intensity aerobic exercise– for 30–35 minutes, 3–5 days a week, for 10–12 weeks – was best at increasing positive moods
      (e.g. enthusiasm, alertness). Physical exercise can be very effective in relieving stress.Physical activity has been shown to have a positive influence on our self-esteem and self-worth.
      This relationship has been found in children, adolescents, young adults, adults and older people, and across both males and females.
      Physical activity can reduce levels of anxiety in people with mild symptoms and may also be helpful for treating clinical anxiety.
      Physical activity is available to all, has few costs attached, and is an empowering approach that can support self-management

          <div class="content">Heyo. So recently, my mental health has seemed to spiral out of control.
            I've gone to several therapists before, but have not stayed with any of them longer than a few visits.
            However, now it seems to me like I might need a mental evaluation. I've been hearing voices, seeing things at night,
             have had a complete lack of motivation and self-confidence, paranoia, and an increase in self-harm.
             It feels like I should probably get checked out before I do something stupid, but I don't know.
             I'm also scared of the conversation with my parents about health, which I would have to have, seeing as the health insurance is through them.
              What should I do? Do I need to get an evaluation, or can I wait until something happens to get one? Thanks in advance.</div>
